### Analysis
249 mice identified with SCC tumors were treated over 45 days with a range of treatments including target drug the company was interested in, Capomulin. One test subjectsâ€™ data was removed entirely as it was not possible to determine which of the data points were valid within the duplicates present. This left 248 test subjects.
- 1. Based on this set of data, Capomulin is the most effective drug for reducing average tumor size in mice.  A close second would be Ramicane.
- 2. There is a positive correlation (0.84) between mouse weight and tumor weight, the tumors are gaining weight along with the mice. More research would need to be done to understand what this correlation means. The composition of the tumors and the tumor growth factors would need to be understood. However, based on the data we have here we can say that mouse weight and tumor weight are positively correlated.
- 3. The least effective drugs were Infubanol and Ceftamin.
